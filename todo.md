# Particle
## Purpose and Outline
Particle is a decentralized web application to publish long form content, with possible monitization. 

### TODO
- Create a seemless sign-up/sign-in process using EVM authentication
- Incorporate centralized social media
- Decentralized content (hosted on ceramic/ipfs) pointers would allow for direct refrencing of perhaps trackable sharing
- The app will be the home for user content but content will be able to be shared using Particle SDK (embeds)
- Move to reducers XD
