# Particle
## Purpose and Outline
Particle is a decentralized web application to publish long form content, with possible monitization. 

### TODO
- Create a seemless sign-up/sign-in process using EVM authentication
- Incorporate centralized social media
- Decentralized content (hosted on ceramic/ipfs) pointers would allow for direct refrencing of perhaps trackable sharing
- The app will be the home for user content but content will be able to be shared using Particle SDK (embeds)
- Move to reducers XD

#### - Components

1. selfid basic profile sign-up editor ( PRIORITY )
2. editor
3. homepage w/ feed


#### - OPENAI
- Image generation from a small piece or entire piece of content
- suggestions for writing variations on larger particles
- maybe linking outside content from twitter to create coherent or collage pieces


#### - ComposeDB
- Ceramic/SelfId is will be deprecated 2023, it will move to a graph based database with sql redudency layer ran alongside the ceramic node
- CeramicTiles are also being deprecated
